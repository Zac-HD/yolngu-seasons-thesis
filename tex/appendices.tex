\chapter{Appendices}
For more detailed discussion of methods that doesn't make a key contribution to the main text of the thesis.

\section{Acknowledgements}
The long list of people who helped in some way.

\section{Ethics} \label{sec:ethics}
Everything related to ethics approval, including letter of invitation etc.

\section{Code and Data}
All the code and data I used, plus intermediate results as relevant.

\section{Other approaches}
Note that where appropriate items in this section would simply be folded into the main text.  Remaining content is likely to be cut before finalisation, but it's a useful dumping ground during the drafting process.

-	things I tried which didn't work – eg code ideas, fieldwork attempts, etc.
-	things I didn't try but might work – ie ideas for further study
-	why I didn't try things I thought were a bad idea or waste of time

It would be really interesting to see further work on the intra-yolngu calendars and their similarities and differences - the weather record really adds something in allowing objectiveish comparisons.
