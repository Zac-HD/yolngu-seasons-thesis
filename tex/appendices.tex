\chapter{Appendices}
\label{ch:appendices}

The printed appendices for this thesis are intentionally minimal.
All the code and data I used are included in the electronic appendices.
Any interested reader who has not received the DVD with this material is
invited to contact me (\texttt{zac.hatfield.dodds@gmail.com}) for a copy.

To ensure long-term preservation of the electronic appendices, they
are provided as a .zip archive with the following SHA1 checksum:

\todo{da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709
(that's the hash of an empty string, as the archive mentioned doesn't exist yet)}



\section*{Additional Figures}
This section contains figures which would unnecessarily disrupt the
flow of the thesis, but should not be left to the electronic appendices.


\begin{figure}[p]

    \caption[Letter of invitation for collaborative research]{
        The formal invitation to study Yolngu seasons,
        and share results with both first and second peoples.
        Pre-existing relationships, with Yolngu and non-indigenous people,
        were essential in arranging this collaboration.

\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{galiwinku/seabreeze-direction.pdf}
    \caption[3-hourly wind direction heatmaps, Galiwinku]{
        3-hourly wind direction heatmaps for Galiwinku,
        showing the northerly sea-breeze in the afternoon.
        Based on this figure, I judged that the difference between
        3pm and 6pm wind for season detection is small enough that
        I prefer the meteorological standard (3pm) over Yolngu advice (6pm).}
