\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter contains a brief introduction to australian indigenous seasonal calendars,
explains the focus, novelty, and delimitations of this research,
and lays out the structure of the thesis.


\section{Indigenous Seasons and Ecological Knowledge}
% - One paragraph on the global-scale reason to care about the topic
% - Lay out how indigenous seasons are defined (inc. international, contrast)
% - draw link to ecological knowledge
% - Explain shortcomings in existing research


This thesis investigates and characterises an indigenous seasonal calendar.
I combine Indigenous knowledge with Western climate science to characterise local seasonality
according to the case study of a Yolngu seasonal calendar,
from NE Arnhem Land (see \autoref{fig:arnhem-map}.


Where Australia's formally recognised seasons are defined by Gregorian date -
e.g. December 1 is by definition the first day of Summer - indigenous seasons
are defined by weather and ecological events.

This more closely matches intuitions about seasons as XXXXX

Indigenous Australian seasons are responsive to interannual climate.

They are also exquisitely localised – each language group is likely to have a unique seasonal calendar, and traditional indicators may be so precisely defined that the flowering of an individual tree has particular meaning to the local community (REF – Richard Baker?).
Yolngu calendars of North-East Arnhem Land divides the year into six seasons based on prevailing wind, rainfall, temperature, and a variety of other factors.
The tropical seasonal pattern can roughly be described as two-stage wet and dry periods, plus transitions – though this description sacrifices important nuances such as the role of winds or flooding.
Derivation of the seasonal calendar from current conditions, along with the impossibility of applying the European seasonal calendar to the tropical seasonality, make Yolngu seasons an excellent case study.




use of ecological changes indicators of seasonal onset or climate change \citep{menzel2006}



Indigenous knowledge is recognised and valued in an increasing variety of contexts
\citep[eg.][]{petheram2011,cochran2015,berkes2008} –
but integration with the physical sciences is still relatively rare and ad-hoc.
%
I argue that such synthesis provides a crucial long-term perspective on
anthropogenic environmental change, and demonstrate that such synthesis can produce novel
results for both scientific and indigenous stakeholders.



Ecological knowledge is embedded in calendars, along with traditional paterns of activity adapted to weather conditions throughout the year.









\section{Delimitations and novelty}

NEEDS PARA ON DELIMITATIONS - see and work from mid-course review feedback to inform this.


Existing research on indigenous calendars has focussed on the social or ecological aspects,
documenting indigenous knowledge – see eg \textit{Man of All Seasons} \citep{davis1989},
the Indigenous Weather Knowledge project \citet{BOM-iwk},
or CSIRO’s Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge (TRaCK) program \citep{CSIROcals,oconnor2010}.
There is however a paucity of research 

Despite the potential to draw insight from the combination of Indigenous Australian seasonal knowledge and climate science, this appears to be a gap in the literature (see \autoref{sec:lit-review}).

PARA ON LIT SEARCH STRATEGY

None of the participants I interviewed were aware of attempts to quantify indigenous seasons,
and several made spontaneous comments as to the novelty of this approach.





\section{Structure of the Thesis}

This document is structured with a variation of the standard format for scientific reports,
where the body chapters for a literature review, methods, and results
have been organised by topic rather than content.

The aim of this format is present the four logical stages of my research
in ordered and reasonably self-contained chapters.

\paragraph{Context:}
\autoref{ch:context}, \textit{\nameref{ch:context}} contextualises the research.
It covers the basic context of the research,
regarding the location and past studies of the Yolngu calendar;
finds a gap in the literature and surveys relevant fields;
and lays out the overarching methodology of and strategy for this research.

Note that while the overarching methodology and general review of the relevant literature
are contained in this section, each of the body chapters describes the applicable methods
and references more specific literature as appropriate.


\paragraph{Qualitative:}
\autoref{ch:seasons}, \textit{\nameref{ch:seasons}} focusses on the qualitative research component.
It discusses interview methods, considerations for indigenous knowledge, and integration with literature.
The primary results are a reflection on process and outcomes,
and a qualitative description of Yolngu seasons.


\paragraph{Bridging:}
\autoref{ch:quantify}, \textit{\nameref{ch:quantify}} shows the creation of a quantified Yolngu calendar.


\paragraph{Quantitative:}
\autoref{ch:analysis}, \textit{\nameref{ch:analysis}} shows the analysis of the quantified calendar.
