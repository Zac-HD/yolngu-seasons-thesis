\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I acknowledge the Yolnu Elders of the Clan Nations of North East Arnhem
Land, who have cared for country since creation, and maintained their
law and sovereign responsibilities in this ancient land.
Their wisdom and knowledge has been passed on to successive generations
through ceremony, art and education.  They have defended their sovereignty
over ancestral lands and waters and their right to administer customary law.

I thank them for their willingness to share so much of their knowledge
and wisdom with me, without which this research would have been impossible.
This thesis is dedicated to our shared hope that Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples can learn from one another and together come to richer understandings
of this country.

Many people have helped and supported through my year of the thesis,
and have my deep gratitude but only a little space here.  Professor Janette
Lindesay and Dr Se√°n Kerins, the best supervisors a student could hope for.
My friends in the Northern Synod, who were so generous and taught me so much.
My Indigenous friends, who insisted that this really could be worthwhile.
The generous staff of CSIRO and the BOM, who took the time to share their
experiences and some raw numbers too.  The people of the Fenner School, who
kept things running smoothly through a sometimes-chaotic year.  And
my family and friends, who encouraged and supported me throughout.
Thank you all.
