\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I acknowledge the Yolnu Elders of the Clan Nations of North East Arnhem
Land, who have cared for country since creation, and maintained their
law and sovereign responsibilities in this ancient land.
%
Their wisdom and knowledge has been passed on to successive generations
through ceremony, art and education.  They have defended their sovereignty
over ancestral lands and waters and their right to administer customary law.

I thank them for their willingness to share so much of their knowledge
and wisdom with me, without which this research would have been impossible.
%
This thesis is dedicated to our shared hope that Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples can learn from one another and together come to richer understandings
of this country.
