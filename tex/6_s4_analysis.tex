\chapter{Section 4:  Analysing Yolngu Seasons through Time}
The purely quantitative methods, results, and interpretive discussion.

\section{Methods}
-	Calculation of summary stats for each season – typical and variation in conditions, onset, etc
-	Comparison of stations, other data as inputs to season recognition.
-	Normalisation functions from observations to gridded data inc. model backcasts if applicable.
-	Correlation to ENSO, monsoon, dipole moment, etc
-	Changes over time (by decade?) – historical data
-	Changes over time – model outputs across models and scenarios
Note that even the simplest of these is really novel, as nobody has been able to calculate the summaries before!

\section{Results and Interpretation}
Outputs from the analyses above, with interpretation.
