\chapter{Analysing Yolngu Seasons through Time}
The purely quantitative methods, results, and interpretive discussion.

\section{Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculation of summary stats for each season – typical and variation in conditions, onset, etc
\item Comparison of stations, other data as inputs to season recognition.
\item Normalisation functions from observations to gridded data inc. model backcasts if applicable.
\item Correlation to ENSO, monsoon, dipole moment, etc
\item Changes over time (by decade?) – historical data
\item Changes over time – model outputs across models and scenarios
\end{itemize}

Note that even the simplest of these is really novel, as nobody has been able to calculate the summaries before!

\section{Results and Interpretation}
Outputs from the analyses above, with interpretation.
