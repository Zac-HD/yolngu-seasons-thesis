\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

The qualitative results fall into three parts.
%
First, personal reflections on my approach to interviews and drawing
from Indigenous knowledge - and how I underestimated the complexity
of seasonal calendars.
%
Second, commentary on how to accurately characterise Yonlgu seasons.
This section covers required datasets, historical changes, spatial
variation in definitions, and three distinct types of season.
%
Third, a Yolngu seaonal calendar drawn from interview responses,
defining a handful of meteorologically-defined seasons each year.

The quantitative results follow, starting with a summary of the
observational weather record.  Finally, the quantified seasons are
presented.



\section{Unexpected Complexity in Seasonal Calendars}
\label{sec:complex-seasons}

Participant-led informal interviews were indispensible to this research --
not for the description of the seasons, which can be found in books
\citep[eg.][]{davis1989,atlas2014} -- but for the complex structures
of knowledge and definitions they revealed.  While I anticipated finding
some unsought information, the unexpected results were surprisingly important.
This section summarises the structurally-relevant `unexpected results',
which are vital to an accurate understanding of the Yolngu seasons.\\


I began this project with many assumptions about Yolngu seasons, which were
slowly broken down by engagemnt with the literature on Indigenous Knowedge,
fieldwork and interviews, analysis, and listening again to the recorded
interviews.

I believe that some were (and a few still are) reasonable -- relationships
and trust built over several years allowed participants to correct
misinterpretation of their contribution, and helped both parties to notice
and work through concepts that do not translate directly across language or
cultural barriers.  Deliberately focussing on Yolngu ideas with similar
function or importance revealed a much richer understanding than
simply asking about seasons.

This focus was inspired by one participant's
comment to me several years ago on why he often addresses a meeting via a
translator: while he is fluent in English, simultaneously translating complex
language and cultural frameworks is slow and difficult.
%
Speaking without the cultural translation, this man showed me aspects of
seasonal calendars that could easily be missed, simply because Indigenous
people may not mention things without a European analogue, and non-Indigenous
researchers may neglect to ask.  My lesson: pay particular attention to the
questions that seem like `simple fact-finding' -- especially in cross-cultural
research, there's no such thing!\\


The breakthrough moment for me came after the third day of interviews.
At this point I had spoken to two Yolngu men and one non-Indigenous
person, and written plenty of notes about anticipating unexpected
information... and it was only when listening again and transcribing
one of the recordings that I actually heard:  \emph{There is no such
thing as `the' yolngu calendar!}  There are many Yolngu seasonal
calendars -- they vary from place to place, have differing details for
men or women, occur on varied temporal scales, and exist for various
purposes.

This is basic, crucial information that I had been told repeatedly over
several days -- and repeatedly missed, due to me preconceived idea of what
`the Yolngu calendar' was like.  I could only agree with the teacher I
spoke to the next day:  ``We [white Australians] are so ethnocentric and
dumb it embarrasses me.''



\subsection{Yolngu Seasons vary by location and temporal scale}
\label{subsec:three-seasons-scales}

Yolngu participants discussed seasons at three distinct temporal scales
each year, each type recognised by different indicators.
\begin{itemize}
\item `Monsoon seasons' - Wet and Dry - are recognised not by rainfall but
        by winds from the north-west and south-east respectively.
\item The six `weather seasons' are defined primarily by wind, rain, and temperature.
        They can begin and end at any time during the year - weather permitting -
        and may occur more than once and in any order.
\item Complex `ecological seasons', where changes in plant or animal life
        signal appropriate activities for that time.  A particular community
        may recognise tens of these, all highly localised.
\end{itemize}

This three-level typology emerged from interview data, prompted by
the patterns in timescale and kinds of indicators for each.
While it forms a more nuanced view than disregarding all but a single or
simplified seasonal calendar, this too falls far short of the richness
and detail of Yolngu understandings.
%
Ian Morris, who was a teacher at the Galiwinku mission for many years, said
\begin{quote}
    Mums and Dads had all this seasonal information in their heads, really
    a lot more but seasons were the key. ...
    I now feel pretty embarassed about the circular seasonal calendar
    [see \cref{fig:yolngu-seasons}]; it's two dimensional with the Balanda
    [non-Indigenous] calendar in the middle.  It should be going out to the
    stratosphere if you put every [ecological detail] in! ... The detail is
    like a galaxy, and you really need three dimensions to visualise it.
\end{quote}

A similar three-level pattern of seasons is visible in \cref{fig:tiwi-seasons},
on page~\pageref{fig:tiwi-seasons}.  The Tiwi seasons are shown at a monsoonal level,
as well as by weather or ecology.  The latter categories are not clearly distinguished
in this figure, though weather is generally further from the center.


\subsubsection{Monsoon Seasons (Wet/Dry)}

Each year, there is a wet season and a dry season.  These seasons are
recognised by the monsoon winds from the north-west and south-east
respectively.  Some years have a gap-filling season between them.

Of the three levels of seasons recognised by Yolngu, the wet/dry monsoon
seasonal cycle is most likely familiar to non-Indigenous people - especially
in the tropics.  Yolngu participants emphasised that these seasons are
\emph{not} recognised by rainfall, but rather the direction of prevailing winds.
\begin{quote}
    I know when seasons start -- the wind told me, when a storm rolled in
    and everything changed.  But the west wind has begun.  That's how I
    know the wet season has begun already, even before it rains.
\end{quote}

Interestingly, this mirrors the meteorological definition of monsoon,
where rainfall is less important than the location of the intertropical
convergence zone and consequent direction of prevailing wind.
This shared understanding of monsoon seasonality should not go unremarked -
but does direct this research to the more local seasonal patterns.


\subsubsection{Meteorological Seasons}

At the middle timescale, Yolngu recognise six seasons.
The Wet season is divided into \textit{Dhuludur}, \textit{Barramirri},
and \textit{Mayaltha}, followed by \textit{Midawarr}, \textit{Dharrathamirri},
and \textit{Rarrandharr} over the Dry.  Detailed descriptions of each
season from interviews, supported by literature extracts, can be found below.
%
These seasons are primarily defined by weather conditions and events,
which are shared across communities in the area.  Ecological indicators
also play a role in recognising meterological seasons, which people
\textit{mangutji bulthanaway} (``possessing the quality of telling the eye'')
can interpret \citep[p35]{atlas2014}.  The distinction from ecological
seasons is supported by local differences in indicators, but ultimately
derives from limitations in the scope of this research rather than
Yolngu understanding.

Quantification and analysis focusses on meteorological seasons.
Data availability is one reason:  the installation of automatic weather
stations at Arnhem Land airports in the 1990s and early 2000s provide
and new but solid daily observational record of many weather variables.
By contrast the Monsoon has been the subject of many studies, while
detailed ecological or phenological records at the required temporal
resolution are very rare.\\


Meteorological seasons also match up reasonably well with mainstream --
that is, European-derived -- ideas of what a season should be.  Wet/Dry
is well-known but permits little nuance, while ecological seasons are
alienatingly complex and detailed.  Six per year and defined by weather
is not \emph{too} exotic for productive collaboration across varied
ideas of what seasons are like!  However, there are also critical
differences that are too rarely shown.

Variable timing appears to be a simple difference; seasons might start
earlier or later depending on the weather.  One participant said
``It's a different time [each year], any season can start at any time.''
In subsequent conversations, he clarified that this is more than just
variable onset -- seasons can `interrupt' one another!  Each season will
occur when conditions are appropriate, at any time and in any order.

Fortunately there are some restrictions -- each season occurs every year,
without exception, and typically dominates a fairly predictable period
of time (simplified and summarised in \cref{tab:quant-seasons-summary}).
These properties shape the detection algorithm used below, and determine
which methods of summarising, aggregating, or simplifying seasonal data
are appropriate.



\subsubsection{Ecological Seasons}
Ecological seasons are defined by observed changes in local vegetation
and animal behaviour.  They embody a depth and detail of Indigenous
ecological knowledge that is difficult to imagine, and only possible
due to the long connection between Yolngu and the natural environment.

Participants explained that these seasons vary between groups even within
a single clan-nation or language group, meaning that each of the towns
across Arnhem Land (see \cref{fig:arnhem-map}) would have a different
calendar. These seasons are closely tied to traditional activities such as
travel, use of particular foods or other resources, and ceremony.

On the Tiwi Seasons Calendar, \cref{fig:tiwi-seasons}, the inner-most
rings concern ecological seasons and observations - such as
\textit{Mumpikari}, when possums leave muddy tracks and hunting them is easy.

However, certain practicalities put ecological seasons beyond scope
for the remainder of this thesis.
The same detail and diversity which makes these seasons so fascinating
also mandates far greater investment of time and travel to speak
with the relevant knowledge holders, and proper study would require
living in each community for a significant period.
Sensitive, sacred, or unpublishable stories and information are much more
common around ecological seasons than the more general calendar,
and researchers have obligations in this area which are not always clear.
Generalisation between communities is difficult if not impossible.
And finally, quantification would be very difficult due to the paucity
of quantitative ecological data at the required level of detail
and localisation, especially in `remote' Australia.

\Cref{sec:further-study} discusses how these seasons might be explored
by further research, and some of the challenges to overcome.



\subsection{Other Advice}
\label{subsec:detection-advice}

Recongising seasons is not always simple.  Yolngu participants made
several comments which, while not about the seasons themselves, are
cucial to a well-grounded attempt to quantify them.

\begin{description}
\item[Variation between years]
    Yolngu seasons vary between years, depending on the weather conditions.
    Participants said that the seasons had always been steady within this
    normal variation, meaning that no long-term trend was recognised.

\item[Unordered or duplicated seasons]
    Seasons are not limited to a particular order, and may happen one or more
    times per year (by definition zero or more; historically at least once).
    Any season may be `interrupted' by another if the latter's characteristic
    conditions hold.  It is important to avoid hasty judgement however, so this
    takes at least two or three days of atypical weather.

    Where non-indigenous people might discuss a `cold snap', Yolngu might
    say that winter had interrupted summer!

\item[Wind and the sea breeze]
    Wind plays a defining role in Yolngu seasons, but not all winds are
    seasonal indicators.  In coastal communities, the day-time and especially
    afternoon wind is dominated by the sea breeze, and carries relatively little
    seasonal information.

    Participants said that morning wind at 9am would be fine, but that at
    3pm the sea breeze overwhelms the seasonal changes.  The suggestion was
    to instead consider wind between 5pm and 8pm depending on time of year.

    With data at three-hourly resolution, \cref{fig:galiwinku-seabreeze-direction}
    does not show a substantially stronger seasonal signal at 6pm than 3pm.
    I therefore use the standard observations of 9am and 3pm for the analysis.
\end{description}

Some lines of inquiry were unproductive, but still deserve reporting.
In other cases, incidental questions or comments raised issues that may
merit further study.

\begin{description}
\item[Extreme Events]
    Extreme weather events do have a place on complex Yolngu calendars;
    one participant used the phrase ``cyclone season'', and described
    conditions such as hot water on the ocean surface and strong winds.
    Participants did not discuss specific events in relation to seasonality.

    However, extreme events do not contribute to the definitions of the
    meteorological calendar described above except through the conditions
    themselves.

\item[Climate Change]
    Participants were generally not concerned about climate change due to
    the greenhouse effect, or it's consequences.  Questions about climate
    change generally elicited responses regarding local or regional
    environmental change, including weather, but mostly attributed to
    local impacts.  This was surprisingly consistent with \citet{petheram2010}.

\item[`Strange changes']
    Participants reported changes in recent decades, including difficulty
    reading seasons due to invasive species.  \todo{R quotes}

\item[Novelty]
    Several participants made spontaneous comments on the novelty of this
    research, and none were aware of any previous attempts to quantify
    Indigenous seasons.  My other contacts in Darwin were likewise unaware
    of any similar study.
\end{description}



\section{A Qualitative Yolngu Seasonal Calendar}
\label{sec:calendar-description}

The remainder of this thesis focusses on the six-season Yolnu calendar with
meteorological definitions, described by this section.
It is based primarily on interview data, within
the framework provided by \textit{Man of All Seasons} \citep{davis1989} and
\textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas} \citep[][p36]{atlas2014} -- recognising that all of these
sources describe different communities and areas.  When sources conflict, I
use participant comments from Galiwinku.

Readers should note that this is not a definitive Yolngu calendar; no such
thing exists.  Instead it represents my attempt to construct a quantifiable
Yolngu seasonal calendar from as many sources as possible, and show some of
the challenges of working with complex, incomplete, and sometimes missing
information.  I am confident that the result is fit for purpose, and -- taken
with \cref{sec:complex-seasons} -- avoids misleading similarities to
more familiar seasonal cycles.

\todo{Note:  I've been going through transcripts and audio again
in the process of writing this section.  That will be done by
Sunday 8 May, so if you want to see a finalised copy let me know
and I'll send it through when I'm done -- not worth holding up
everything else for this alone.}


\paragraph{Dhuludur} marks the beginning of the seasonal cycle.  It is the
first of three predominantely wet seasons, before the heavy rain begins.

\todo{more participant input}


~\\
\citet{davis1989} calls Dhuludur the `pre-wet' season:
\begin{quote}
    The weather is cool and still during the night, with mists settling in the night
    and rising in the morning after a light northwest wind during the day. ...
    The winds are mixed up, with southwest, southeast, northeast, and northwest winds
    each blowing at different times, often during the same day. ...
    The weather begins to get hot and humid as the clouds build up more and more each day.
    When the sky is covered by heavy cloud, the `female' thunder brings the first rain [often from the southeast].
    After the first rain, other winds bring heavy rain. ...

    Towards the end of the pre-wet season the rain is being brought only by the northwest wind.
    It rains almost every evening.
    This is the start of the next season, which is signified by heavy rains and growth.
\end{quote}

The \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas} says that in Dhuludur ``there are not many
fires, the wind blows at different times throughout the day. Now there is
a lot of thunder.''



\paragraph{Barramirri} is the season of heaviest rain.

Participants noted that the rain and water is so pervasive that maintaining
a fire to stay warm is very difficult, and
\todo{more participant input}

~\\
\citet{davis1989} calls Barramirri `the season of heavy rain and growth':
\begin{quote}
    The heavy rain is brought by the northwest wind. It comes every day,
    indicating that the seasons have changed. ... As the northwest wind
    brings daily storms, the sea is dirty and rough. ... The inundation
    is so extensive that much of the inland is now one continuous sheet
    of water which will not drain until the dry season. ...

    Many plants flower, and the rain becomes infrequent and sometimes
    stops for several weeks.  These are indications that the season of
    heavy rain is drawing to a close.
\end{quote}

The \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas} says that ``in Barramirri, the late wet,
heavy rain falls almost every day, encouraging the grass to grow tall
and quickly.''.



\paragraph{Mayaltha} is the season of plenty.  It does not appear in
\cref{fig:yolngu-seasons} \citep{davis1989}, but was described by
participants and appears in the \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas}.  Mayaltha's
place in the three-level taxonomy of seasons (\cref{subsec:three-seasons-scales})
is less clear than other seasons; while usually a meterological season
it is sometimes considered to fit between the Wet and the Dry seasons.

In this monsoonal context it is distinctive as the season without notable
downsides - one participant described eager anticipation, saying
\begin{quote}
    whatever you want, it's ready; favorite foods... \todo{find correct quote}
\end{quote}
\todo{more participant input}

~\\
\citet{davis1989} calls Mayaltha the `flowering' season:
\begin{quote}
    [The Flowering Season] is marked by an abundance of plants that
    flower, bright sunny days, cool breezes, and occasional rain. ...

    During the early wet season strong winds often brought the rain.
    The wind then stopped as the rain fell.  Now the winds blow hard
    even when it is raining.  The rains do not come daily any more,
    but only every week or two.
\end{quote}

The \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas} says that ``Mayaltha is a time of sunny days
with an occasional shower.  Now we will visit the outer islands again.''.



\paragraph{Midawarr} is recognised at Milingimbi as the season of plenty,
but may be folded into Mayaltha when that season is considered at the
monsoonal scale.  This is a concrete example of the variation in calendars
between communities -- this merger is more common at Galiwinku -- and the
complexity and richness of seasons as a source of ecological knowledge.

\todo{more participant input}


~\\
\citet{davis1989} calls Midawarr the `fruiting' season:
\begin{quote}
    The east wind signals the beginning of the time of abundant food ...
    the first southeast wind blows gently in the early morning. ...
    The daily storms and strong winds are nearly over.
    The northwest wind changes to the northeast, bring rough seas.
    Early in the season the storms still bring heavy rain daily.

    By the middle of the season the wind has changed to the east and
    heavy storms are less frequent.  Light easterly winds blow
    throughout most of the day bringing cooler weather. ...

    Shortly after sunrise the east wind blows and continues for the
    rest of the day.  Towards the end of the fruiting season, the days
    are becoming  more like the early dry season with morning mists.
    One last storm of the wet season comes and flattens the tall dry grass.
    This storm is brought by strong southeast wind, which is the main dry season wind.
\end{quote}

The \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas} calls Midawarr ``the time of
flat water when the yams become abundant in the bush.''.



\paragraph{Dharrathamirri}, or Dharratharraway, is the first part of the
true dry season.

\todo{more participant input}

On participant referred to Dharrathamirri as ``winter'', as distinct from
Rarrandharr ``the dry season'' -- marked more by wind and low temperature
than the lack of rain.



~\\
\citet{davis1989} calls Dharrathamirri the `early dry' season:
\begin{quote}
    In the early dry season the night sky is again mostly clear and the three stars of
    \textit{Djulpan} (Orion's Belt) are seen in the west in the early night sky,
    and reach the horizon before people go to sleep.
    This is the time when the storms come and knock the grass down.

    When the rain has stopped and the southeast wind is blowing constantly,
    the dry season has really started.
    After the first storm the wind varies in direction.
    Heavy dews come with the light ESE to SE wind that blows every night.
    When we are well into the season the wind swings SE to SSE and becomes stronger

    The southeast wind blows stronger in the latter half of the season.
    The next season does not start immediately.
    The northeast, southwest, and southeast winds vary for a few weeks.
\end{quote}

The \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas} says ``the east wind turns westerly and
the dew becomes heavier.''.



\paragraph{Rarrandharr} is the final and deepest part of the Dry season.

One participant described how to travel in such hot conditions -- starting
the journey early in the morning, resting in shade through the heat of the
day, and tricks for walking over very hot sand and rocks in bare feet.
\todo{more participant input}

~\\
\citet{davis1989} calls Rarrandharr the `main dry' season:
\begin{quote}
    The east-southeast wind blows; the cold mornings and mist are nearly gone.
    This is an intermediate season between the early dry and main dry seasons.
    It is very short, lasting only a few weeks.

    The warmer southeast wind starts to blow...
    When the wind dies down, soon the three stars of \textit{Djulpan}
    will begin to rise in the east before people go to sleep at night.

    When the mangoes are nearly finished, the dry season is also near its end.
    The weather changes and thunder begins.
\end{quote}

In the \textit{Yan-nhangu Atlas}, ``Rarrandharr season brings the
north-east wind of the late dry that burns your feet''.



\section{The Observational Weather Record in NE Arnhem Land}

Before conducting detailed analysis, it is often useful to summarise and
visualise the raw data.  This section presents an overview of the
observational weather record in NE Arnhem Land, with a particular focus
on Galiwinku and Milingimbi.

While some stations have been open for many years -- the first observations
at Warruwi Airport were taken in 1916 -- the complete record is more recent.
All data required for season detection have been collected beginning with
the installation of airport automatic weather stations across Arnhem Land
in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  \Cref{tab:weather-station-summary} shows
the five weather stations from which I draw an observational record.\\


\Cref{tab:galiwinku-monthly-summary} shows average conditions for each
month at Galiwinku.  \Cref{fig:galiwinku-climograph}, above, is a monthly
climograph of rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, and dewpoint at
Galiwinku.  Note the low variation in temperature, and strong seasonal
patterns in rainfall and humidity.

\todo{should I reproduce the climograph here?  Or is a reference enough?}

\todo{monthly summary of wind?  Would be simplified vector field, not
sure if this is worthwhile... and might need to (maybe) show speed too.}

\Cref{fig:compass-rose} shows the mapping of colour to wind direction used
for the figures below.  These colours are drawn from the HSL colour space,
which uses a polar (cylindrical) coordinate system for hue, saturation,
and lightness (hence, ``HSL'').  With constant saturation and lightness,
hue can be mapped directly to wind direction and equidistant colours
have similar perceptual difference - at least within reproduction tolerances.

The direction-colour mapping was `rotated' - from red at North to red at West -
to ensure that the contrast of prevailing monsoon winds is blue/yellow,
rather than red/green which would disadvantage colourblind readers.

\Cref{fig:galiwinku-observations,fig:milingimbi-observations}
show historical weather observations at Galiwinku and Milingimbi as a set of
heatmaps (panels, arranged vertically).  \Cref{fig:how-read-multipanel}
gives a detailed walkthrough of how to read these figures.
%
Unlike the climograph above, these figures clearly show variation in timing
of seasonal onset between years.  This demonstrates that timeseries data
at daily resolution is required for investigation of Indigenous seasons.
%
The degree of seasonal variation in each indicator is also clearly visible:
minimum temperature varies more than maximum; wind direction varies more in
the morning while wind speed varies more in the afternoon (both due to the
sea breeze).

\caption[How to read multipanel heatmaps]{How to read multipanel heatmaps}
\label{fig:how-read-multipanel}
    Multipanel heatmaps have several advantages: they concisely express a
    great deal of data, and make trends or variability between years clearly
    visible.  They are designed to show all the details of hetrogenous data
    that would usually be hidden by sumarising or aggregating it to a simpler
    form.  Detail sometimes comes at the expense of readability, so this tutorial
    walks through how to read and interpret \cref{fig:galiwinku-observations},
    which shows forty-eight thousand weather observations at taken Galiwinku.\\

    Each heatmap is a grid, with year on the y-axis and day-of-year on the
    x-axis, which is shared by all panels.  Each cell is then shaded according
    to the value observed on that day; days  without data are shaded black.
    Years of observation are printed to the left of each panel, as y-axis labels.
    At the bottom of the figure, the x-axis is labelled by month -- the data
    is daily, but numerical day-of-year labels are generally unintuitive.
    To the left of each panel is the colour key, and the name of the variable.
    This color key is identical for panels of the same variable, even across
    figures, for easier comparison.\\

    Let's start with the topmost panel, which shows the five-day mean for
    daily rainfall.  The first row of data is mostly black, indicating missing
    values -- this station began observations in October 1999.  Other gaps,
    where the record was interrupted for a few days or weeks, are visible in
    all panels; apparently the station was mostly non-functional between June
    and October 2015.
    %
    Rainfall is clearly seasonal, but also intermittent:  there are a series
    of large rainfall events in most years until late-April, then little if any
    rainfall until November.\\

    The next panels show maximum and minimum temperature.  Note the scale to
    the right of the panel - even the lowest minimum temperatures rarely drop
    below 18 degrees C at night!  Daily maximum temperature fluctuates in the
    early months of the year, and careful inspection hints that low temperatures
    may be related to heavy rainfall.\\

    The bottom four panels are probably the most complex, and form a pair of
    pairs: wind speed and direction in the morning, and in the afternoon.
    %
    The monochrome (blue) panels show wind speed.  Until March, wind speed at
    both times is dominated by rainfall events -- knowing that the wind is also
    high, we could properly call them storms -- and in later months a clear
    divergence is visible, showing that the sea breeze is most notable from
    September onwards.
    %
    The colourful panels show wind direction; \cref{fig:compass-rose} gives
    the key.  The morning data shows a clear Westerly / South-easterly / Northerly
    wind regime through the year, while the afternoon wind -- sea breeze --
    tends to blow mainly from the north or (less often) south-east.

\section{Quantifying a Yolngu Calendar}
\label{sec:applying-seasons-method}

\todo{Proposed changes to figures (dad); correct pagination etc of figures}

In this section, the qualitative data describing a Yolngu seasonal
calendar is applied to the observational weather record, deriving
a numerical specification for each season and ultimately a best-effort
timeseries of which season was `observed' on each day.\\

To avoid bloating this section, only figures for the seasons at Galiwinku
(Ngayawili weather station) are included in the text.  Corresponding
figures for all other stations can be found in the electronic appendicies;
interpretation of the figures below includes descriptions and comparisons
where relevant.

\Cref{tab:quant-seasons-summary} summarises typical timing and recognition
criteria for each season.  \Cref{fig:season-definitions-code} shows the
implementation of these conditions in Python3 code -- normalised later --
which create the time-series shown in \cref{fig:galiwinku-seasons}.

        Seasons are defined by numerical criteria for each day, such as
        ``rainfall greater than 10mm'', or ``maximum temperature below mean''.
        Applying a criterion to the weather data gives a timeseries with 1 or 0
        for each day, and the raw index for each season is the element-wise
        sum of the applied criteria that define it.

        not represent onset timing; seasons do not always occur over
        contiguous periods.
        }
    \label{fig:galiwinku-season-pie}
\end{wrapfigure}

\Cref{fig:galiwinku-season-pie} shows the proportion of days on which
each season was detected.  Like \cref{fig:compass-rose}, it also
shows a repeated colour scheme -- all season figures below use the
same colour palete, without further labelling.\\


\Cref{fig:galiwinku-seasons} is a multi-panel heatmap, using the same format
as \cref{fig:galiwinku-observations,fig:milingimbi-observations} above.
Each season has an individual panel showing the index for that season on each
day, derived by taking the raw index from \cref{fig:season-definitions-code}
and applying a four-day rolling mean and converting to a z-score (standard
deviations from the mean) to allow direct comparison between indicies.
%
The topmost panel is an aggregated version, showing which season on each day
had the greatest index -- the crucial timeseries for any further analysis.

Note the clear distinction between Midawarr (purple), Dharrathamirri (yellow),
and Rarrandharr (light blue) -- the dry seasons.  This clear pattern in the
all-seasons panel arises from the distinctive and largely non-overlapping
peaks in the index value for each season, forming a diagonal pattern over
the lower three panels.
%
On the other hand, Dhuludur (dark blue), Barramirri (green), and Mayaltha
(red) are not clearly distinguished in their individual patterns.  This
manifests in mixed occurance shown on the all-seasons panel, and is also
clearly visible in the summarising figures below.\\

\Cref{fig:season-daily-index,fig:season-daily-prob} represent two distinct
approaches to summarising the data shown in \cref{fig:galiwinku-seasons},
without erasing or misrepresenting the variability that is a key
characteristic of Yolngu seasons.

\Cref{fig:season-daily-index} is a simple line chart, showing the mean
per-day index for each season.  This shows the degree of distinction
between seasons; lines of similar heights show seasons which describe
typical conditions with similar predictive power.  That Dharrathamirri
has the highest peak means it is most distinct -- southeast wind and no
rain describes it well, and also matches other seasons very poorly.
Note however that these indicies are independent.\\

\Cref{fig:season-daily-prob} takes a different approach, showing empirical
probability of observing each season on a given day of the year.  These
data are further smoothed by a running weekly mean, to remove noise
introduced by the small sample size (only 10-15 years for each station).

This tells a similar story to the index lines, but readers should note
that these figures are seperately derived from the data shown in
\cref{fig:galiwinku-seasons}.  Most importantly, observed occurance
rates are not independent -- when one season is observed more, others
must be observed proportionally less.  This property amplifies the
difference between indicies on a year-by-year basis, which clearly
shows variability between years or `strong second' finishes.

        but muddle in the Wet (Dec-Feb).
        This is not indicative of poor detection on a single day,
        but rather that occurence varies more between years.

        lost in aggregation.
