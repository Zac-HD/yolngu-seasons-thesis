\chapter{Abstract}

Australia presents challenging environment and variable climates.
Better ways of understanding our natural environment are urgently needed, and
offered in the rich knowledge of Indigenous Australians -- knowledge which
is too often dissmissed, ignored, and undervalued.
%
This thesis develops an approach which integrates traditional seasonal knowledge
with quantitative and analytical science, demonstrated by investigating Yolngu
seasons in NE Arnhem Land.

Where previous studies of Indigenous seasons and calendars in Australia have
recorded weather, social, and ecological characteristics of seasons -- treating
them as objects of study -- this thesis treats Yolngu seasons as a framework
for study, working with Yolngu participants to create a quantified calendar
based on the observational weather record.  No known previous research has quantified
Indigenous seasons in this way.


The methodology is cross-disciplinary and exploratory, drawing on the two-ways
research literature and pre-existing relationships.  Informal, participant-led
interviews with Yolngu people provide qualitative descriptions of the seasons, the structure of
the calendar, and advice on how they might be analysed.
%
The key findings of this thesis are qualitative, some directly from interviews
-- eg. the structure of Yolngu calendars and definitions of the seasons; while
others follow numerical analysis -- quantifying and characterising the seasons.


Yolngu participants describe monsoonal, meteorological, and ecological
seasons with distinct time-scales and indicators.  Seasons can occur in any
order, even `interrupting' one another depending on indicator conditions.
These properties are not recorded by previous research.
%
Yolngu seasons are defined by environmental observations rather than the
passage of time, the specifics of which vary substantially with location --
as do their names and even what seasons are recognised.  Detailed qualitative
descriptions were collected to create a seasonal calendar.
%
Each season was described in terms of daily weather and these definitions
applied to the observational data, deriving the first known timeseries of
season occurance.  This dataset allows characterisation of the seasons,
and the first ever quantitative investigation of their timing.  Discussion
of how to accurately characterise this timing forms the final direct
contribution of this thesis.

The methods and methodology developed in this thesis are suitable for use in
other research.  The code which quantifies Yolngu seasons in terms of weather
conditions is robust and reusable, and could be adapted for study of the
qualitative structure and definitions of other calendars.
Flexible methodology for integration of Indigenous and quantitative
scientific knowledge and knowledge systems is applicable in domains far beyond
seasonal or ecological knowledge.  Participant-led conversations followed by
quantitative investigation uncovers and highlights unanticipated information
and perspectives across cultural boundaries.


This thesis contributes to academic knowledge by the publication of novel
findings, development of methods to quantify Yolngu seasons, and demonstration
of a research approach which integrates Indigenous and scientific perspectives.
%
The outcomes support future research, which may consider seasonal calendars in
other location or in greater depth -- or integrate Indigenous and non-Indigenous
knowledge about other topics.  These studies could extend scientific knowledge
and understanding, as well as supporting concrete applications.  In either case
they would contribute to a novel and genuinely local understanding of what it
means to be Australian.
