\chapter{Appendices}
For more detailed discussion of methods that doesn't make a key contribution to the main text of the thesis.

\section{Acknowledgements}
The long list of people who helped in some way.


\section{Ethics} \label{sec:ethics}
Everything related to ethics approval, including letter of invitation etc.

There must be a standard form of words for this; reference approval number etc.

        The formal invitation to study Yolngu seasons,
        and share results with both first and second peoples.
        Pre-existing relationships, with Yolngu and non-indigenous people,
        were essential in arranging this collaboration.

\section{Code and Data} \label{sec:appendix-code}
All the code and data I used are included in the supplementary material,
attached as electronic appendices.  Additional copies available on request.

To ensure long-term preservation of the electronic appendices, they
are provided as a .zip archive with the following SHA1 checksum:

da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

(that's the hash of an empty string, as the archive mentioned doesn't exist yet)



\section{Other approaches}
Note that where appropriate items in this section would simply be folded into the main text.
Remaining content is likely to be cut before finalisation,
but it's a useful dumping ground during the drafting process.

-	things I tried which didn't work – eg code ideas, fieldwork attempts, etc.
-	things I didn't try but might work – ie ideas for further study
-	why I didn't try things I thought were a bad idea or waste of time

It would be really interesting to see further work on the intra-yolngu calendars and their similarities and differences - the weather record really adds something in allowing objectiveish comparisons.


\section{Non-core Figures}
This section contains figures which are not key to the argument of the thesis,
but important enough to print rather than leaving to the electronic appendices.

\begin{figure}[p]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{galiwinku/seabreeze-direction.pdf}
    \caption[3-hourly wind direction heatmaps, Galiwinku]{
        3-hourly wind direction heatmaps for Galiwinku,
        showing the northerly sea-breeze in the afternoon.
        Based on this figure, I judged that the difference between
        3pm and 6pm wind for season detection is small enough that
        I prefer the meteorological standard (3pm) over Yolngu advice (6pm).}
