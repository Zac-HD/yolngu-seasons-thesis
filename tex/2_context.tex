\chapter{Context and importance of this research}
\label{ch:context}
This chapter covers the basic context of the research,
regarding the location and past studies of the Yolngu calendar;
finds a gap in the literature and surveys relevant fields;
and lays out the overarching methodology of and strategy for this research.

This study focusses on North-East Arnhem Land, particularly Elcho Island
and the town of Galiwinku.  Figure~\ref{fig:arnhem-map} shows the study area.
Qualitative seasonality is described for Galiwinku and Milingimbi;
quantitative weather observations are from Waruwi, Maningrida, Milingimbi,
Galiwinku, and Nhulunbuy.

These sites are all in Yolngu country, in the Anrhem Coast bioregion \citep{ens2014}.
The landscape is dominated by tropical woodland, from mangroves on the coastline 
through dense forest to more open woody grasslands further inland.

The Yolngu people are among the oldest living cultures on Earth.
Yolngu also have a tradition of engagement across cultures, including
the Macassan trade with Indonesia in the 1700s and engagement with Methodist
missionaries through the 1900s.

The Yirrkala Bark Petition (\autoref{fig:bark-petition}) marks a crucial
point in the Australian land rights movement, recognised by indigenous and
non-indigenous people alike.  It is also prone to misinterpretation by those
who see a document in two languages with a decorative border: the border
is the most important part!  (see caption, expand this section)

        The Bark Petition concerns the bauxite mining lease granted at Nhulunbuy
        without consultation with Yolngu, and helped kick-start the Australian
        land rights movement.

        The petition is presented in three ways: text in English,
        text in Yolngu Matha, and in the border.

        and the most important part of the document.

In a letter inviting collaboration on this research (see \autoref{sec:ethics}),
a senior Yonlgu man explained that:

\blockquote{
    For Yolngu (the people of North Eastern Arnhem Land) it is the Liyagadhaman
    who carry within them the wisdom and knowledge of these matters.
    It is right that in this research you have approached me to talk about these
    things. I can also introduce you to others who have this knowledge.  ...

    Yolngu have made careful observation of the ways of nature and the seasons
    over the millennia and have passed on that knowledge down the generations.
    We know the changes that are taking place in the seasons and I am willing
    to talk with you about what I have seen happening around me.
}




The BOM describes the 
climate as ``hot and humid'', with daytime temperatures between 25 and 40 
degrees year-round.  Rainfall and humidity are dominated by monsoon 
seasonality, and the seasons are commonly described by non-indigenous residents 
as “the Wet” and “the Dry” – though after a few years many also recognise “the 
Buildup” of pre-wet humidity \citep{willmett2009}.

The key meteorological determinants of seasonality are temperature (especially 
night-time), rainfall, humidity, and wind strength and direction.  The annual 
cycle is driven primarily by the Indian Ocean monsoon.  The seasonal effect of 
temperature is felt most strongly at night, as daytime temperatures are very 
consistent and the latent heat of available water has a strong effect.

However, wet/dry/buildup misses important nuance in the seasonality of the 
area.  \autoref{fig:yolngu-seasons} shows one summary of Yolngu seasonality,
with significantly more seasons.  \citet{woodward2012b} notes
\blockquote{
    four factors that interconnect within each of the seasonal
    knowledge systems; a focus on resource use, knowledge of complex
    ecological indicators to facilitate resource collection,
    knowledge of meteorological phenomena and a strong
    metaphysical/spiritual understanding.

\section{Methodology and Research Framework}

My guiding research questions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item What Yolngu seasonal calendars are generally recognised?
\item Which best affords cross-cultural collaboration?
\item What are the properties and changes that define this calendar?
\item How may these seasons be characterised with respect to temporal and physical patterns in climate?
\item What, if anything, about these seasons is changing in the historical record?
\item What might happen under future climate change?
\end{itemize}

I build on existing literature and primary research by deriving a physical
characterisation of the Yolngu calendar, combining traditional Indigenous
knowledge with numerical climate science. Using threshold values in meteorological
variables rather than a predefined date range enables analysis of means and
variation in the timing of onset, duration of seasons, and annual patterns
in climatological variables.

Preliminary work suggests that these definitions can also be applied to
reconstructed or modelled climate data, allowing investigation of trend
or abrupt changes over time. Well-founded definitions may allow scenario-based
investigation of a wider range of conditions than exist in the historical record.

NOTE below this is todo, needs more structure and content.

\subsection{Relationship-building}
Discuss the relationship-building stage in some detail; it's really important.
May however become a part of the fieldwork methodology... at least if I set up
methodology to reflect structure of body chapters.


Relationships are a key part of cross-cultural research.  See Sue Smith, as 
Sean has mentioned.

This collaborative and cross-cultural approach has been and will be a 
significant influence on the direction of the research. (explore it more then)

Without a high level of engagement, including introductions and logistical
assistance with travel permits, it would be impractical or impossible to conduct
such research for an Honours thesis.


\subsection{Two-ways research}
Broaden approach; not just two-ways – read other research methodology and 
situate work

Around the world, and more recently in Australia, there has been growing 
interest in `two-ways' research \citep{turner2009,prober2011}, 
which \blockquote{uses combinations of Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and 
methods, and with the involvement of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people 
towards a common goal} \citep{ens2014}.  

However, working across knowledge systems can be difficult for both Indigenous 
and non-Indigenous people, and often challenges institutions and research 
funding bodies to invest substantial time and resources in relationship-
building with uncertain outcomes.  The Ngan'gi Seasons Calendar emphasises 
ecological events and customary activities for each season above the timing and 
meteorological conditions.  Produced in collaboration between Ngan'gi knowledge 
holders and the CSIRO, `success' required a long-term commitment to work in 
remote areas on the Daly River, a high degree of risk tolerance in 
research funding, and many years work building solid relationships \citep{woodward2010}.

TODO - A bit thin; expand benefits and value of knowledge

When \citet{petheram2010} investigated perspectives on climate change 
adaptation in NE Arnhem Land; the community engaged in terms of resilience to 
existing issues rather than adaptation to climate change, challenging the basis 
of their research.  With severe problems related to poor housing, drug abuse, 
and extensive mining land degradation, climate change is of little concern to 
participants who mostly attribute `strange changes' to local environmental 
damage \citep{green2010a}.



\subsection{Fieldwork and interviews}

\begin{itemize}
\item Why I'm doing primary data collection, why fieldwork
\item Why personal conversations with minimal structure, why avoiding surveys etc.
\item Explain cultural sensitivities etc
\end{itemize}


Existing research on Australian Indigenous Calendars has generally been 
published on posters or occasionally in books, and focusses on passively 
recording and reporting Indigenous knowledge of seasonality on its own terms.  

My primary motivation for fieldwork and primary data collection is thus that 
the existing data is not well suited to the inquiries I wish to make – not just 
how the calendar is defined, but also to elicit the knowledge required to 
independently recognise the seasons.  This includes historical questions about 
past seasons and climate, hypotheticals about what the interpretation of 
unlikely events might be, and many others listed below.

Rather than structured interviews or a written survey, I conduct minimally-
directed conversations with research participants.  Bringing avoidable 
paperwork to an indigenous community is generally not culturally appropriate, 
as it can devolve into mutual frustration rather than mutual learning.  An 
assumption of literacy may exclude potential participants where English is 
often a fourth (or sixth, or later!) language.

Calendars and seasons are a topic which is not usually secret business, though 
there may be particular sacred topics associated with them.  Especially with an 
explicit invitation to come and learn, there is little risk of inappropriate 
sharing of information.

Yolngu have long memories and significant knowledge of their 
calendar.  People in the community can share their experience and different 
perspectives.  Elders bring an important perspective, but so do younger people 
and those engaged in Ranger groups or related work.


\subsection{Bridging Qualitative and Quantitative methods}
This is a vital area, particularly when working across cultures too.
TODO - discuss approach, how exploratory qual becomes the foundation,
etc.  More details can be found in \autoref{ch:quantify}.


\subsection{Numerical Analysis}
Pretty standard; it's the preceeding bit that enables novel results.
See \autoref{ch:analysis} for details.
