\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

%  Needs to lay out the wider -- global -- story of why seasons are important,
%  which becomes a narrative thread throughout the thesis.
%  This should answer the `why bother' question, and justify the research.
%  Another ongoing thread is `multiple approaches yield richer results'.

This thesis will investigate and characterise an Indigenous seasonal calendar.
I combine Indigenous knowledge with Western climate science to characterise
local seasonality in NE Arnhem Land (see \cref{fig:arnhem-map}),
as described by a Yolngu seasonal calendar I construct based on
interviews and supported by literature.

Previous research \todo{REFS} has focussed on the social or ecological aspects of Australian
Indigenous calendars.  This thesis instead treats Indigenous knowledge as a
\emph{framework for} research, not simply an \emph{object of} research.
Togther with an cross-disciplinary approach quantifying Indigenous seasons,
my results are highly novel -- and indeed, to my knowledge unique.



\section{What are Seasons?}

Seasonal calendars are constructed by humans as a usefully simplified
abstraction of annual variation in the environment - whether physical
changes such as temperature, or social events from birthdays to financial
reporting.  The definitions of seasons carry knowledge about annual cycles,
and also the domain for which the calendar is applied - eg. temperature
or taxation.
%
Documenting and quantifying seasons defined by biophysical conditions
or events allows researchers to draw on a significant body of existing,
implicit knowledge about the environment.

This knowledge supports decisions in a range of areas; from natural
resource management, agriculture, or energy demand forecasts, to
the timing of meetings and holidays or the materials used in high fashion \todo{insert refs for examples}.
Seasons have a profound impact on human societies, and understanding
them matters.  Knowledge of biophysical seasonality provides a nuanced
basis for assessments of climate change impacts, or the success of
adaptation or mitigation policies.  This will only become more important
as we move into the Anthropocene, and -- for good or ill -- humans assume
direct control over the environment.


Australia formally recognises four seasons, defined by Gregorian date:
Summer begins on December 1\textsuperscript{st}, Autumn on March
1\textsuperscript{st}, Winter on June 1\textsuperscript{st}, and Spring
on September 1\textsuperscript{st} \citep{wells2013}. This follows the
meteorological standard for seasons, originating in Europe, rather
than the solar seasonal calendar marked by solsticies and equinoxes.
%
Throughout the temperate zone, seasons are informally recognised more by
temperature than date (Summer being the hottest and Winter the coldest time
of year), and thus varying from year to year.  While rainfall is often
strongly  seasonal the relationship varies from place to place, and it is
less recognised as an indicator.
%
However, temperate seasons are essentially irrelevant to the tropical and
equatorial climate of northern Australia.  In these areas a monsoonal Wet
and Dry season dominate, generally recognised by weather conditions.
This system is highly simplistic, lacking any of the nuance or local
knowledge embedded in Indigenous calendars.  Australia would be well
served by a more modern view than this European inheritance.


An alternative way of defining seasonal cycles is by periodic ecological
events, whether plant (date of first flowers, etc) or animal (eg. migration).
The study of such events is called \textit{phenology}, which forms an
important complementary approach to meteorology in assessment of climate
change \citep[eg.][]{roy2000}.  \citet{menzel2006} analyse spring onset timing
at several sites across the United Kingdom and Germany, using dozens of
plant phenophases and butterfly appearance data, and find a strong climate
change signal in earlier onset and increased variability.  Such research
draws on written records, which generally begin in the 1700s for European
data or as early as the eighth century for Japanese observations \citep{sparks2002}.

Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) is derived from a significantly longer
tradition.  The ecological and phenological knowledge embedded
in Indigenous calendars may provide a rich complement to written records,
or an alternative in the many cases where such records do not exist \todo{REFS}.


Australian Indigenous seasons are defined by weather and ecological events.
They are typically recognised after the fact, and vary in timing and length
between years depending on the behaviour of their indicators.  This study
focusses on the seasonal calendar of the Yolngu people, in Arnhem Land (see
\cref{fig:arnhem-map}).
%
The Yolngu seasonal calendar is reasonably complex - see
\cref{subsec:three-seasons-scales} - but there are six major seasons
analysed below, defined by prevailing wind, rainfall, temperature, and a
variety of other factors.  The exact definitions are highly localised,
and vary slightly even between communities sharing the same language.



\section{Research Context}
\label{sec:context}

This study focusses on North-East Arnhem Land, particularly Elcho Island
and the town of Galiwinku.  \Cref{fig:arnhem-map} shows the study
area, on the north-east coast of the Northern Territory about five hundred
kilometers east of Darwin.
%
These sites fall within the Anrhem Coast bioregion \citep{ens2014}.
The landscape is dominated by tropical woodland, from mangroves on the coastline
through dense forest to more open woody grasslands further inland.
%
Qualitative seasonality is described for Galiwinku and Milingimbi;
quantitative weather observations are from Waruwi, Maningrida, Milingimbi,
Galiwinku, and Nhulunbuy.  Waruwi and Maningrida are in areas described by
other calendars, but provide a longer weather record in a similar climate.

The Yolngu calendar and this study area were chosen as the case study for
this thesis for several reasons.  Personal connections and logistical support
from the Uniting Church greatly facilitated qualitative research.  The
Yolngu seasons emphasise meteorological indicators, which allows principled
quantification based on the observational weather record.  Finally, research
on Indigenous seasons or even nuanced tropical seasons is rare in Australia,
and may be valuable in informing traditional or western land and natural
resource management.

In a letter inviting collaboration on this research (see \cref{sec:ethics}),
a senior Yonlgu man explained that
\begin{quote}
    For Yolngu (the people of North Eastern Arnhem Land) it is the Liyagadhaman
    who carry within them the wisdom and knowledge of these matters.
    It is right that in this research you have approached me to talk about these
    things. I can also introduce you to others who have this knowledge.  ...

    Yolngu have made careful observation of the ways of nature and the seasons
    over the millennia and have passed on that knowledge down the generations.
    We know the changes that are taking place in the seasons and I am willing
    to talk with you about what I have seen happening around me.
\end{quote}

\citet{woodward2012b} explains four key aspects of Indigenous seasonal
knowledge systems: ``a focus on resource use, knowledge of complex
ecological indicators to facilitate resource collection, knowledge of
meteorological phenomena and a strong metaphysical/spiritual understanding.''.
This emphasises the nuance and value of Indigenous knowledge of tropical
seasonality, which goes far beyond the Wet/Dry/Buildup cycle recognised
by non-Indigenous locals \citep{willmett2009}.

The key meteorological aspects of Arnhem Land seasonality are temperature,
rainfall, humidity, and wind strength and direction; the annual
cycle is driven primarily by the Indian Ocean monsoon.  The climate is hot and
humid, with daytime temperatures between 25 and 40 degrees year-round.



\section{Scope and Contribution}
\todo{merge with context to remove overlap}

Indigenous knowledge is recognised and valued in an increasing variety
of contexts \citep[eg.][]{petheram2010,cochran2015,berkes2012} -
but integration with the physical sciences is still relatively rare and
\textit{ad hoc}.  Work in this novel area would bear substantially more study than
is possible within the time and resource constraints of an Honours thesis,
making a clear scope particularly important.
%
Three important limits are to consider the calendar of only one Indigenous
language group, consider recent data and understandings only (avoiding
investigation of past or future change), and avoiding overly complex
analysis in a poorly understood field.

This research investigates Yolngu seasons in North-East Arnhem Land, in
the area of Galiwinku and Milingimby.  The qualitative data describes the
definitions of seasons and conditions in recent decades; the quantitative
weather record begins with the installation of automatic weather stations
at several airports between 1990 and 2003  (some earlier observations exist,
but do not include all required variables).  The results do not support
speculatation on the past or future state of Yolngu seasons.  The methods
however are applicable to data such as climate models, which provide
a clear direction for further work.

The research questions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item How are Yolngu seasonal calendars defined, and does this vary?
\item Which Yolngu calendar is best suited for mixed-methods study?
\item What are the properties and changes that define this calendar?
\item How may these seasons be characterised by meterological parameters?
\end{itemize}
These questions follow the same four-step methodology as the project itself:
understand the system to ask meaningful questions; identify key
qualitative information; apply insights to construct exact definitions; and
finally conduct quantitative analysis. followed by comparisons and interpretation.


This research is not a deep or rigorous exploration of historical Yolngu
perspectives; all interviews were conducted in English and in Darwin, and
the small number of participants limits investigation of the social or
cultural aspects of Indigenous Knowledge.  The climatological analysis
does not consider trend change, or more than basic correlation with
wider climatic forcings.

Instead, the novelty and value of this work is in synthesis: bringing
togther Yolngu perspectives on the natural environment, and the
data-oriented approach of climate science.  A review of the literature
finds previous work on Indigenous seasons focused on qualitative description, but
no quantitative or numerical research (see \cref{sec:aus-indig-seasons}).
Such synthesis provides a crucial long-term perspective on
anthropogenic environmental change, and may produce novel and valuable
results for both scientific and indigenous stakeholders.




\subsection*{Thesis Structure}

The chapters of this thesis -- Introduction, Literature Review, Methods,
Results, Discussion, and Conclusion -- follow the usual convention for
a scientific report.  Within the Methods and Results chapters
the structure is slightly more complicated, due to the use of iterative and
cross-disciplinary approaches.  Quantitative methods are informed by
qualitative results, necessitating forward references.  Readers may wish
to read these chapters as paired sections, which reflects the research
process.
