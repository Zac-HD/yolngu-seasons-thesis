\chapter{Discussion}

Interpretation of the results is above â€“ this section is not to unpack what the results are or how to interpret data.  It focusses on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Relevance and novelty of the results
\item Applications
\item Directions for further research
\item Limitations of the approach (generally; detailed bits either above or as appendices)
\end{itemize}
Plus more to come.
