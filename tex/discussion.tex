\section{Discussion of Results}
\label{sec:disc-results}

\subsection{Qualitative and Interview Results}

\todo{detailed interpretation of the qualitative results.
Focus on the unexpected - complex seasons.  This reinforces the
methodological importance of qualitative methods -- there's no
point at all to numerical analysis on wrong premises!
}


\subsection{Detection of Seasons}

\todo{
Note that trend- and event-based approaches were tested and didn't work.
Discuss how well season detection worked, nondistinctiveness of wet
season.  Propose algorithm with memory to fix this.  (and implement?)
Really hammer home the non-european-ness of these seasons,
including by listing the shortcuts that would not be well supported.
}


\subsection{Quantitative Analysis}

\todo{discuss this stuff}



\section{Discussion of Exploratory Methods}
\label{sec:disc-methods}

\todo{What were the methods?  How well did they work?
Are they applicable to other calendars?  If so, to what extent?
}




\section{Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:disc-limitations}

\todo{Write in general terms about what -- of the in-scope things --
were limitations or didn't work.  Where did scoping hurt?
What could or should have been done better?  How much was foreseeable?
Detailed critique belongs in specific sections above, though.
}



\section{Applications or Benefits of the Research}
\label{sec:applications-benefits}

Thinking about novelty here.  Also relevance to people's lives,
industry, etc.  Argue that I'm contributing to the ongoing process
of non-Indigenous Australians adapting to this country.

\todo{Still missing an elucidation of why the research matters to Yolngu -
and everyone else!}
Looking at abstract benefits (contribution to knowledge, valuing Indigenous knowledge),
but also cover concrete benefits - what activities in northern australia
in particular (eg land and NR management) will benefit from these insights?
Key aspect: how transferable are these insights?

Seasons provide powerful heuristics for the expected range and variability in
weather for a given time of year.

-	Implications of seasonality, relationship to NRM, applications, meaning of
change, what does this way of thinking translate into action


Quantitative knowledge of local indigenous seasonality can improve practises in
natural resource management, fire control, agriculture, and tourism -
particularly outside the temperate zone.  Seasons can provide powerful
heuristics for the expected range and variability in weather, and may yield
insights into patterns of change.  For practical use, a local and long-tested
seasonal calendar has substantial advantages over one imported from Europe.


See Barber 2005 ``where the clouds stand'' (about Tiwi Islands)

This research is expected to make a novel contribution to knowledge, raise
awareness of Yolngu culture, and improve understanding of the climate
seasonality of NE Arnhem Land.  The methods demonstrate two-ways research in
combining indigenous knowledge with numerical data to characterise seasons.

For non-technical communities, both Indigenous and non, discussing climate
change in terms of seasonality is more meaningful than degrees of warming.
Framing the impacts of climate change in terms relatable to lived experience
has the potential to boost engagement with and understanding of the major
results of climate science - after all, everyone has some experience of the
weather!

For the Yolngu community, increased engagement with the science around climate
impacts has benefits for both adaptation choices and advocacy for mitigation,
which are particularly important for coastal communities living off the land.
Yolngu have expressed strong interest in other records of and perspectives on
past environmental changes.

For non-indigenous Australians, this research contributes to the continuing
process of learning to live on this continent, discarding `maladaptive traditions'
- eg our poor infrastructue planning for drought and fire (REF the future eaters).



\section{Directions for Further Study}
\label{sec:further-study}
\todo{Intro each subsection; add examples, add detail and specifics}

Having demonstrated the viability of quantitative analysis of Indigenous
seasons, and discusses the value of such research, there are three distinct
directions for further study:  breadth, depth, and extent.


\subsection{Breadth of Study}
is more calendars, more locations, etc.

Replication of this study with other Indigenous calendars would be
valuable in each case, and the ability to compare calendars and investigate
possible correlations between local climate and how seasons are
defined could yield fascinating insights.

Similarly, comparing the calendar of a single language group across
multiple sites and subtly different climates could be very interesting.
An `objective' weather record could really help researchers to draw out
the differences between calendars, and perhaps see some of the subtleties.



\subsection{Depth of Study}
is intra-calendar comparison, going into IEK, etc.

Investigating Indigenous ecological seasons could provide deep insights
into local ecology and traditional natural resource management.
The principle challenges are resourcing, to collect the quantitative
data required to `translate' back to western science, and lengthy
investment in time and relationships required.

Look at patterns of interuptions within single years.  Are there distinct
kinds of seasonal occurance that a year may exhibit?



\subsection{Extent of Study}
looks at linking to wider context eg climatic correlations.

The methods used in this study can be applied to any dataset which
includes a daily record of the relevant variables.  This enables
investigation of changes over time -- past or future -- and scenarios
including a wider range of conditions than exist in the historical record.
I plan to conduct and publish such a study using forecast and backcast
model outputs from the ACCESS and CMIP5 ensembles immediately
after graduating.
