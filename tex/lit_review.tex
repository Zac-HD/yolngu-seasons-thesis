\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch:lit-review}

This thesis seeks to investigate Yolngu seasons from two main perspectives:
a cross-cultural, qualitative exploration of Indigenous knowledge, and
based on this exploration attempt numerical definition and analysis.
%
The literature review consists of three sections.  The first gives a general
overview of the literature on Indigenous Knowledge and methods for respectful
research with Indigenous people.  The second describes a scientific
understanding of monsoon systems and tropical seasonality, along with previous
approaches to quantitatively describing seasons based on weather events.
The final section covers previous research on Indigenous seasons in northern
Australia, and identifies a gap in this literature which this thesis seeks
to fill.


\section{Indigenous Knowledge}
\label{sec:lit-iek}

\todo{this section still needs work}


% INTRO AND TERMINOLOGY

There is a growing recognition among ecologists, natural resource managers, and
scholars worldwide that Indigenous peoples hold important knowledge about the
natural environment.  The literature on Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK)
is well-established and vibrant, across a wide range of specific topics.
\citet{berkes2012} defines Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) as ``a cumulative
body of knowledge, practice and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and
handed down through generations by cultural transmission''.

Indigenous knowledge systems not related to ecology are also widely recognised,
and described by a variety of terms:  \citet{clarke2009} refers to `land-based
knowledge', \citet{petheram2010} and \citet{turner2009} use `traditional
ecological knowledge', while \citet{cochran2015} simply use `indigenous
knowledge'.  This thesis uses the term `Indigenous Knowledge', following the
letter of invitation for this research (\cref{app:invitation-letter}) and
emphasising that ecology is not the only subject of Indigenous knowledge.



\subsection{What is IK?}

% WHAT MAKES IK UNIQUE?

\citet{turner2009} distinguish Indigenous knowledge systems from `objective'
scientific knowledge on the basis that Indigenous knowledge of practical
matters is value-laden and observations or experience are tangled with beliefs,
philosophy, law, and spirituality.  \citet{woodward2012b}, working in northern
Australia, describes Indigenous seasonal knowledge systems as having strong connections
to ecological knowledge, weather knowledge, resource collection, and spirituality.

\todo{links to ecology here}


% WHAT IK IS USED FOR

In Australia and around the world, the value of Indigenous knowledge is recognised
in areas as diverse as climate change and sustainability assessment
\citep[eg.][]{cochran2015}, holistic fire management \citep[eg.][]{clarke2009,price2012},
customary economic activities including aquaculture \citep{woodward2012a}, and
natural resource management \citep[eg.][]{prober2011}.  The \textit{Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999} suggests taking `a
partnership approach to environmental protection and biodiversity conservation'
\citep{ens2012}, which is increasingly common at local and state levels.
%
\citet{green2010a} and \citet{clarke2009}
demonstrate the use of Indigenous phenological and climate knowledge to improve
western scientific understanding of past and future climates.

\todo{WHY IS THIS KNOWLEDGE IMPORTANT - expands to why my research matters.
(related to fine-scale timing, as the nuance matters in land and NRM)}


\todo{
Link research in historical climate change somewhere.
Have strong link between Indigenous seasons and phenology --
look for IweatherK too, BOM site?
}





This literature provides a rich context for synthesis of indigenous knowledge
and western climate science to investigate Australian seasonality.
TO WHAT END?



\subsection{Research with IK}
\todo{+
Broaden approach; not just two-ways - read other research methodology and
situate work.  Really really need to do this.
Also bring in historical climate change, as this is the best place to put it.
}

Around the world, and more recently in Australia, there has been growing
interest in `two-ways' research \citep{turner2009,prober2011},
which ``uses combinations of Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and
methods, and with the involvement of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people
towards a common goal'' \citep{ens2014}.

However, working across knowledge systems can be difficult for both Indigenous
and non-Indigenous people, and often challenges institutions and research
funding bodies to invest substantial time and resources in relationship-
building with uncertain outcomes.  The Ngan'gi Seasons Calendar emphasises
ecological events and customary activities for each season above the timing and
meteorological conditions.  Produced in collaboration between Ngan'gi knowledge
holders and the CSIRO, `success' required a long-term commitment to work in
remote areas on the Daly River, a high degree of risk tolerance in
research funding, and many years work building solid relationships \citep{woodward2010}.

\todo{A bit thin; expand benefits and value of knowledge}

When \citet{petheram2010} investigated perspectives on climate change
adaptation in NE Arnhem Land; the community engaged in terms of resilience to
existing issues rather than adaptation to climate change, challenging the basis
of their research.  With severe problems related to poor housing, drug abuse,
and extensive mining land degradation, climate change is of little concern to
participants who mostly attribute `strange changes' to local environmental
damage \citep{green2010a}.


\subsection{Research with Indigenous People}

VERY INCOMPLETE

Rather than structured interviews or a written survey, I conduct minimally-
directed conversations with research participants.  Bringing avoidable
paperwork to an indigenous community is generally not culturally appropriate,
as it can devolve into mutual frustration rather than mutual learning.  An
assumption of literacy may exclude potential participants where English is
often a fourth (or sixth, or later!) language.

Calendars and seasons are a topic which is not usually secret business, though
there may be particular sacred topics associated with them.  Especially with an
explicit invitation to come and learn, there is little risk of inappropriate
sharing of information.


Relationships are a key part of cross-cultural research.  See Sue Smith, as
Sean has mentioned.

This collaborative and cross-cultural approach has been and will be a
significant influence on the direction of the research. (explore it more then)




\section{The Tropical Climate and Seasons}
\label{sec:lit-tropical-climate}

\todo{this section still needs work}

This section presents a short introduction to the quantitative scientific
perspective on the tropical climate and seasons, covering the large-scale
drivers of the seasons, detection of monsoon onset, and previous
weather-based season definitions in northern Australia.


Tropical climates and seasons are driven by three global patterns of
atmospheric circulation:  Hadley cells, the coriolis effect, and the axial
tilt of the earth.

Hadley cells are a feature of the global atmospheric circulation
caused by the change in insolation -- solar energy delivered per area --
with latitude.  Insolation is greatest at the equator, and the hot air drops
rain as it rises and cools, then spreads towards the poles at high altitude.
At the surface, air tends to move towards the \textit{inter-tropical
convergence zone} (ITCZ), causing the trade winds and distinctive wet band
of the tropics.  The mid-latitude and polar cells shape climates at higher
latitudes, but are not directly relevant to tropical seasonality.

Monsoon seasonality can be understood as the ITCZ moving north or south,
following the latitude of greatest insolation -- which changes due to the
axial tilt of the Earth as it orbits the sun.  While this is strongly
associated with rainfall, the fundamental indicator is the direction of
the prevailing wind: generally south-easterly below the ITCZ, and generally
north-westerly above.  \Cref{fig:itcz-india-aus} shows how this pattern
manifests in reversed seasons between India and Northern Australia.
The presence of the ITCZ is associated with the Wet season and greatest
rainfall, and it's absence with the Dry season.

        Hadley Cells, and the Intertropical convergence zone (`ITCZ').
        Air rises at the ITCZ, heated by the highest - intensity sunlight.
        This causes a low-pressure band of trpoical rainfall, and the
        trade winds -- deflected towards the west by the Coriolis Effect.

        associated with the ITCZ.  \citep[image:][]{boos2014}}
    \label{fig:itcz-india-aus}
\end{figure}

At a more local scale, a monsoonal cycle is often described with a `Wet' and a
`Dry' season; in the Northern Territory both are warm to hot, with distinctive
changes in humidity and wind direction.  The characteristic pattern of tropical
seasons -- distinct hot/wet and cooler/dry periods -- is clearly visible in
monthly averages for temperature and rainfall, which are given for the study
area in \cref{tab:galiwinku-monthly-summary,fig:galiwinku-climograph}.
Note that the more nuanced patterns described by Indigenous seasons are not
visible in these summaries; \cref{ch:results} shows that this level of detail
requires analysis of daily observations.

\subsection{Quantitative handling of seasons}

Some stuff will move here.  Eg Norway (iirc) winter detection,
references for various approaches to threshold detection,
impact of non-locally-monotonic trends, etc.

Historical climatology is important in that it informs my methods,
but also for the concept and to contextualise the research.  May lead to
some comparisons between `lay knowledge' and IEK (an important point).


There is a considerable body of literature dealing with seasons defined
by observed environmental change - from temperature thresholds in
Scandinavia to 'leaf out' for botanists or butterflies for zoologists.

While such definitions are highly dependent on context, some common
elements can be observed.

Monotonic changes and qualitative changes are easiest to pin down.
Ie binary states, and/or only passing the threshold once per year.

\todo{more on this, add references.}

I've started reading the literature on historical climatology, but don't have
enough depth to write much yet.  It's going to be an important angle though.

Matching oral history with numerical data is an established technique in
climate science, as recorded observations can greatly assist in reconstruction
of conditions before the instrumental record began.  In this case, observations
within living memory are an excellent source, as the instrumental record is
still relatively sparse in Arnhem Land.  Investigation of social adaptation to
local climate is an interesting and often closely linked field.

Look more into non-observational records; as far as I know dendrology etc has
not been done much in the region; this is relevant as a missing alternative to
oral histories.

\citet{holland1985} considers rainfall-based definitions of the
monsoon, which demonstrate good agreement with definitions based on zonal
wind at 850 millibar altitude.  He ultimately concludes that pre-monsoon
rainfall varies too much between sites (due to local conditions and events)
to serve as a useful definition on a wider scale.
%
However, surface-level station observations may still form a useful basis for
understanding indigenous calendars, which are -- for similar reasons -- also
non-comparable between sites.

\citet{cook2001} take a slightly different approach to the seasonal cycle of
Northern Australia, defining the `dry' season as the period where the probability
of no rain for ten days is greater than 50\%.  The `rainy' season is defined by
the complement (\textless50\% chance of no rain), beginning slightly before the
monsoon and ending slightly after.  Within the rainy season, the `Wet' season
is defined as having less than a `10\% chance of a ten-day dry spell.
%
Cook \& Heerdegen justify these definitions by their close relationship with
ecological patterns, especially spatial patterns in tropical vegetation,
and argue that a proper understanding of tropical seasonality in Northern
Australia must account for rainfall events outside of the monsoon period.

        Davis -- for the distinct Yolngu calendar at Blue Mud Bay.

The European seasons -- Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring -- are adapted for
agriculture in temperate regions with low inter-annual variability, which
allowed the formal definitions to move from temperature-based to date-based
defintions.  These seasons now begin and end with the orbit of the Earth
around the Sun -- at dates given either by the solstices and equinoxes, or
by the first day of certain months (months were redefined away from the
lunar cycle in \todo{YEAR by Pope NAME, cite}).


Australian Indigenous seasonal calendars are qualitatively different.
Instead of date, seasons are defined by weather events and ecological cycles,
with all the sensitivity to local context and variation between years that
implies \citep[eg.][]{davis1989}.  An enormous volume of ecological and
resource-management knowledge is embedded in these calendars, and passed
down over many generations in highly complex ways \citet{barber2005}.
%
\citet{woodward2012b} explains that Australian Indigenous seasonal knowledge
consists of four key aspects: ``a focus on resource use, knowledge of complex
ecological indicators to facilitate resource collection, knowledge of
meteorological phenomena and a strong metaphysical/spiritual understanding.''.
This emphasises the nuance and value of Indigenous knowledge of tropical
seasonality, which goes far beyond the Wet/Dry/Buildup cycle recognised
by non-Indigenous locals \citep{willmett2009}.


Despite the novely and potential value of combining Indigenous seasonal
knowledge with quantitative climate science, this topic is a persistent gap
in the Australian literature -- \citet{cochran2015} demonstrate this potential
in assessment of climate monitoring methodology in the Tiquie River basin,
in South America.  Keyword searches in the ANU library collection, Google
Scholar, and a number of publishers did not return any relevant results.
Previous studies of Yolngu seasons have tended to treat Indigenous Knowledge
as an \emph{object of} academic research; this thesis additionally treats
Yolngu knowledge as a \emph{framework for} research.
