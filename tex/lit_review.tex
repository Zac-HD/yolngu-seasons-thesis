\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch:lit-review}

The literature review is broken into five sections.  I first examine
what a season \emph{is}; how they are defined and why this matters.
I then explain tropical seasonality as understood by climate scientists,
before giving an academic perspective on Indigenous Knowledge.
I cover the literature on Indigenous seasons with a particular
focus on Northern Australia, and finally identify a broad gap in the
literature which this thesis begins to fill.



\section{What are Seasons?}

TODO: Relationship to phenology and historical climate change

I canvas the concrete applications of
seasonality and the potential benefits of this research.

what constitutes a season (weather, time, or ecology?),
and the role of phenology in determining seasons as a link in to Indigenous
calendars.

Seasons – specifically what makes something a season – is obviously key.
Passage of time is one simplistic definition.  Others look at meteorology, or
at ecology... which ties into phenology, which leads us back to Indigenous
Seasons in the next subsection!


Growing use of phenology in description of climate and climate change; similar
use in IEK

Phenology is the study of timing in ecological events, usually associated with
the first such event in a given year – such as the date of bloom for flowering
plants, or the first sighting of migratory species.  Plant phenology is so
closely associated with temperature (especially in temperate regions) or water
availability (in arid regions) as to be a common proxy for measurement of such
variables (REF).

Some phenological records in Europe go back centuries, and recent analyses show
their significant value in understanding past climate conditions.
\citet{allstadt2015} look at leaf-out phenology as a definition of spring
in the USA.  \citet{menzel2006} examine changes in butterfly presence in the
UK under observed climate change.




\section{The Tropical Climate}

Tropical seasonality, including monsoon and ENSO

Still too narrow; needs a section on the climatology of the region (a pag-ish),
section includes map of ITCZ and intro to monsoon systems; lays out simple scientific view.
(REF - Cook and Hedergan (sp?) on monsoon onset, Int. J. of Climatology).

Need to cover why seasons matter (reinforcing introduction); should tie
closely into section on tropical climatology (Put climograph from results here instead?)



\autoref{fig:galiwinku-climograph} is a typical example of tropical seasons.
To see the more nuanced patterns described by Indigenous seasons, daily data is required.

        temperature (dotted line).}

\end{figure}


\section{Indigenous Knowledge}

There are a variety of terms used in the literature to describe Indigenous
ecological knowledge systems:  \citet{clarke2009} refers to `land-based knowledge',
\citet{petheram2010} and \citet{turner2009} use `traditional ecological
knowledge', while \citet{cochran2015} simply use `indigenous knowledge'.
\citet{berkes2012} defines Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK) as ``a cumulative
body of knowledge, practice and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and
handed down through generations by cultural transmission''.  I prefer
`Indigenous knowledge' to emphasise that ecology is not the only subject of
Indigenous knowledge – for example, seasonal calendars often have cultural and
economic as well as ecological importance.

WHY IS THIS KNOWLEDGE IMPORTANT - expands to why my research matters.
(related to fine-scale timing, as the nuance matters in land and NRM)

There is a growing recognition among ecologists, natural resource managers, and
scholars worldwide that Indigenous peoples hold important knowledge about the
natural environment. The literature on IEK is well-established and vibrant.  In
Australia and around the world, the value of Indigenous knowledge is recognised
in areas as diverse as climate change and sustainability assessment
\citep[eg.][]{cochran2015}, holistic fire management \citep[eg.][]{clarke2009,price2012},
customary economic activities including aquaculture \citep{woodward2012a}, and
natural resource management \citep[eg.][]{prober2011}.  The \textit{Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999} suggests taking `a
partnership approach to environmental protection and biodiversity conservation'
\citep{ens2012}, which is increasingly common at local and state levels.

\citet{turner2009} distinguish Indigenous knowledge systems from `objective'
scientific knowledge on the basis that Indigenous knowledge of practical
matters is value-laden and observations or experience are tangled with beliefs,
philosophy, law, and spirituality.  \citet{green2010a} and \citet{clarke2009}
demonstrate the use of Indigenous phenological and climate knowledge to improve
western scientific understanding of past and future climates.
EXPAND THIS PARA, see also recent Woodward paper.

This literature provides a rich context for synthesis of indigenous knowledge
and western climate science to investigate Australian seasonality.
TO WHAT END?



\subsection{Two-ways research}
Broaden approach; not just two-ways – read other research methodology and
situate work.  Really really need to do this.

Around the world, and more recently in Australia, there has been growing
interest in `two-ways' research \citep{turner2009,prober2011},
which \blockquote{uses combinations of Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledge and
methods, and with the involvement of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people
towards a common goal} \citep{ens2014}.

However, working across knowledge systems can be difficult for both Indigenous
and non-Indigenous people, and often challenges institutions and research
funding bodies to invest substantial time and resources in relationship-
building with uncertain outcomes.  The Ngan'gi Seasons Calendar emphasises
ecological events and customary activities for each season above the timing and
meteorological conditions.  Produced in collaboration between Ngan'gi knowledge
holders and the CSIRO, `success' required a long-term commitment to work in
remote areas on the Daly River, a high degree of risk tolerance in
research funding, and many years work building solid relationships \citep{woodward2010}.

TODO - A bit thin; expand benefits and value of knowledge

When \citet{petheram2010} investigated perspectives on climate change
adaptation in NE Arnhem Land; the community engaged in terms of resilience to
existing issues rather than adaptation to climate change, challenging the basis
of their research.  With severe problems related to poor housing, drug abuse,
and extensive mining land degradation, climate change is of little concern to
participants who mostly attribute `strange changes' to local environmental
damage \citep{green2010a}.




\section{Australian Indigenous Seasons}

Summarise, compare and contrast Indigenous seasons literature.
Indigenous knowledge of phenology stretches back millennia – and much is
encoded in the seasonal calendars and traditions.\\


Documenting indigenous calendars – see eg \textit{Man of All Seasons} \citep{davis1989},
the Indigenous Weather Knowledge project \citet{BOM-iwk},
or CSIRO’s Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge (TRaCK) program \citep{CSIROcals,oconnor2010}.


This section is not finished, but you get a pretty good idea where it's
going.  Mainly it needs to be fleshed out with examples, references, etc.

Indigenous seasonal calendars are qualitatively different to the European
system, which was marked by lunar and later solar cycles.  By contrast,
Australian indigenous seasonal calendars are defined by climatic and ecological
cycles, with all the sensitivity to local context and variation between years
that implies.

For practical use, a local and long-tested seasonal calendar is likely to have
substantial advantages over one imported from Europe – at least for
applications which depend on an understanding of Australia's environment, such
as fire or natural resource management.

European seasons are adapted for agriculture in temperate regions.

Australian Indigenous calendars are generally adapted to a hunter-gatherer,
more mobile lifestyle.  They also must cope with a far higher degree of
interannual variation and offer more complex detail to be as useful.  It's no
coincidence that the calendar is based directly on the important climate
variables and marked by ecological events:  instead of ``the Wet is usually a
good time for these foods'', the knowledge is more like ``after the first big
storm (which marks this season), all the fish gather in these places''.



TODO - survey the general and specific projects documenting Australian Indigenous
seasons, and comment on each.

General - BOM-IWK, CSIRO TRaCK project, CDU?.  For Yolngu seasons, Davis, Atlas, and I.

\section{The Gap in the Literature}

There is a paucity of research which treats indigenous knowledge
as a \emph{framework for} research, instead of an \emph{object of} research.
This gap in the literature persists despite the novely and potential value
of combining Indigenous seasonal knowledge with quantitative climate science.

After -detailed search strategy-, I was unable to identify any studies which
quantified indigenous Australian seasons.  PARA ON LIT SEARCH STRATEGY


MOVE TO RESULTS: none of the participants I interviewed were aware of
attempts to quantify indigenous seasons, and several made spontaneous
comments as to the novelty of this approach.



\section{Methods}


\subsection{Research with Indigenous People}

VERY INCOMPLETE

Rather than structured interviews or a written survey, I conduct minimally-
directed conversations with research participants.  Bringing avoidable
paperwork to an indigenous community is generally not culturally appropriate,
as it can devolve into mutual frustration rather than mutual learning.  An
assumption of literacy may exclude potential participants where English is
often a fourth (or sixth, or later!) language.

Calendars and seasons are a topic which is not usually secret business, though
there may be particular sacred topics associated with them.  Especially with an
explicit invitation to come and learn, there is little risk of inappropriate
sharing of information.


Relationships are a key part of cross-cultural research.  See Sue Smith, as
Sean has mentioned.

This collaborative and cross-cultural approach has been and will be a
significant influence on the direction of the research. (explore it more then)



\subsection{Quantitative handling of seasons}

Some stuff will move here.
