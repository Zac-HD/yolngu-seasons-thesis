\chapter{Seasons and Calendars across cultures}
The purely qualitative methods, results, and interpretive discussion.

\section{Methods}
%Qualitative; snowball interview recruitment with three 'seeds' (Yolngu, UCA, Science).
%Reflecting on results, it's more complex than I first thought.

I initially planned to gather qualitative data on the Yolngu seasonal calendar
from published resources and interviews with Yolngu people.
Over the course of my research, several unforseen approaches have also proved important.

I conducted a series of informal, semistructured interviews centered around discussion of seasons and climate.
Recruitment was primarily by a `snowball' pattern, where participants were asked to
suggest further potential participants.
See \autoref{sec:ethics} for details of the human ethics approval.
The main `seeds' of this pattern were personal contacts, some Yolngu and some non-indigenous
people who have spent decades living and working in remote communities.
I followed several disconnected threads such as the \citet{CSIROcals} project,
which helped to clarify and test my interpretation of the interviews.

I rely on four sources of knowledge and context for the Yolngu seasons, in rough order of importance:

\begin{itemize}
\item Interview with Yolngu people form the basis of my qualitative research, and
        are the definitive source of information about Yolngu seasons.
\item Interviews and discussion with non-indigenous researchers or teachers experienced
        in remote communities help contextualise this knowledge, and warned of
        common misinterpretations - as well as pointing out nuance.
\item Published literature, particularly around cross-cultural research \citep[eg.][]{smith1999},
        Australian indigenous seasons \citep[eg.][]{prober2011,oconnor2010}, and Yolngu
        seasons directly \citep{davis1989}.
\item Grey literature, such as posters produced for use in remote schools, workbooks
        for cross-cultural teacher training, etc.
\end{itemize}

The literature contextualises and informs the interviews, and suggested many fruitful
directions for direct questions or later searches for documents.


Following the interviews, I also engaged in substantial reflection on the nature of
my questions and the ambiguity of the responses and data I collected.

\emph{TODO: expand points to paragraphs, with quotes}

\begin{itemize}
\item all in english
\item what is a season
\item what is a calendar
\item there is no ``the'' yolngu calendar - varies spatially,
        multiple seasonal calendars for different temporal scales with varied purposes
\item `simple fact-finding' really isn't!
\end{itemize}





\section{Results and Discussion}

The qualitative results are fall into four subsections.
First, a review of the literature relevant to Yolngu seasons, including unpublished documents.
Second, personal reflections following my interviews, as above.
Third, a summary of the emergent themes in my interviews.
Fourth and finally, a Yolngu seasonal calendar drawn from interiew responses and aligned with \citet{davis1989}.


\subsection{Literature describing Yolngu Seasons}
This section is focussed on \textit{Man of All Seasons} \citep{davis1989},
with extra commentary from various posters supplied by Ian Morris.


\subsection{Reflection - Complex Calendars as an emergent theme}

`Calendar' and `season' are not concepts that translate directly across cultures. 

Discuss how I realised this, by re-listening to recordings, and that I was expecting something unforeseen (but not like this!).  



\subsection{Yolngu Seasons - varying by location and temporal scale}

Yolngu participants discussed three levels of seasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Wet-Dry seasonality, based on the monsoon winds;
\item A six-season calendar defined primarily by wind, rain, and temperature; and
\item Phenological seasons, where ecological events signal appropriate activities.
\end{itemize}

A similar system is visible in \autoref{fig:tiwi-seasons}, showing the Tiwi seaons at
a monsoonal level, as well as more precise seasons defined by weather or ecology.

        This calendar shows month of year in the outermost ring,
        then three `major' Tiwi seasons recognised by weather.
        Note that \textit{Kumunupunari} does not have a sharp boundary with \textit{Tiyari}!
        Within this ring are smaller seasons, recognised by weather
        or ecological events and associated with particular activities.

Of the three levels of seasons recognised by Yolngu,
the wet/dry monsoon seasonal cycle is most likely familiar to non-indigenous people -
especially in the tropics.  Yolngu participants emphasised that these seasons
are \emph{not} recognised by rainfall, but rather the direction of prevailing winds.

Interestingly, this mirrors the meteorological definition of monsoon, where rainfall is less important than
the location of the intertropical convergence zone and consequent direction of prevailing wind.
This shared understanding of monsoon seasonality should not go unremarked -
but does direct this research to the more local seasonal patterns.


The phenological seasons are very interesting, but several practical barriers to detailed study exist.
For this thesis, the paucity of relevant phenological data means that
investigating these seasons is beyond scope.
Further research would require living in the study area for several years,
and the results are not generalisable as calendars with these timescales and indicators
vary between communities even in the same language group.  INSERT SUPPORTING QUOTES

\subsection{Describing a Yolnu Seasonal Calendar}

The remainder of this thesis focusses on a particular Yolnu calendar,
that of six seasons as recognised at Galiwinku on Elcho Island.
